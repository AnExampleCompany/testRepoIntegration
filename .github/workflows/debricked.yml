      # Choosing the right container image for your scan can be important. 
      # All Debricked images are here: https://hub.docker.com/r/debricked/cli

      # Resolution images (contains "resolution" in tag) are bigger, but comes with a lot of pre-installed package managers: 
      # Here are the dockerfiles: https://github.com/debricked/cli/tree/main/build/docker
      # This is the easiest way to integrate, but it may be better 
      # to run debricked scans in you build images. 

      # You can choose between debian and alpine images, where we do alpine by default. 
      # We recommend to use debian images for scanning Python projects, as the scanner will not 
      # need to compile some common c-based dependencies like pandas.

      # Here we run the Debricked CLI, where you have multiple options to configure your scan. 
      # The CLI repo can be found here: https://github.com/debricked/cli
      # Docs to CLI: https://portal.debricked.com/debricked-cli-63/debricked-cli-documentation-298
      # I recommend you to download the CLI and explore the commands (./debricked -h)
      # You can for instanice configure the CLI to: 
      # - Not resolve manifest-files
      # - Generate callgraphs
      # - Filter out different paths to be scanned or not scanned with glob patterns
      # - Run resolution, callgraph generation, etc, in separate steps in more complex builds. 
      
      # The base "debricked scan" does all this with sane default values.
